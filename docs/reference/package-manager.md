# Pantry package manager

This reference is reproduced from Pantry [`v0.10.40`](https://github.com/pantry-pm/pantry/tree/v0.10.40)
at immutable commit [`d8d4e2f15c871e9ee3c59ab10a4974c21c5fd182`](https://github.com/pantry-pm/pantry/tree/d8d4e2f15c871e9ee3c59ab10a4974c21c5fd182).
The copied contract and its executable evidence are checksummed in
[`evidence/pantry/evidence.lock.json`](https://github.com/stacksjs/white-paper/blob/main/evidence/pantry/evidence.lock.json).
Stacks relies on this boundary; it does not redefine Pantry behavior.

The text below is the upstream implementation contract. Normative words apply
to Pantry at the pinned revision, not to every historical Pantry version.

This document describes the package-manager behavior implemented by the native
Zig CLI in `packages/zig`. It is a contract and operations reference, not a list
of intended features. `bun run docs:contracts:check` links every critical claim
below to its command registration or implementation source and fails CI when the
documentation drifts.

## Scope and source of truth

Pantry manages three related dependency classes:

| Class | Resolution source | Installation shape | Primary implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| System tools and runtimes | Pantry's generated recipe catalog and binary metadata at `registry.pantry.dev` | Versioned native archives, binaries, shims, and environment links | `packages/zig/src/packages`, `packages/zig/src/install` |
| JavaScript packages | npm-compatible metadata, with the resolved URL and integrity claim retained in `pantry.lock` | Extracted package tree under the configured modules directory | `packages/zig/src/install/installer.zig`, `packages/zig/src/install/pipeline.zig` |
| Workspace and local packages | Workspace manifests, `workspace:` ranges, and Pantry's local-link registry | Linked or copied workspace package with resolved external dependencies | `packages/zig/src/cli/commands/install/workspace.zig`, `packages/zig/src/cli/commands/link.zig` |

The generated system catalog is local to the CLI, so normal search and package
classification do not require an online third-party catalog. Live Pantry-registry
search supplements the generated catalog for newly published packages. npm is a
separate compatibility and JavaScript dependency source; it is not Pantry's
system-package registry.

## Manifest discovery and precedence

Pantry recognizes project manifests including `pantry.json`, `package.json`, and
the YAML dependency files documented in the quick start. A workspace root owns a
single `pantry.lock`; workspace package constraints are recorded separately from
their resolved package entries. Explicit CLI package arguments narrow or extend
the manifest operation depending on the command.

Configuration precedence is:

1. explicit command options;
2. project configuration (`pantry.toml` and supported dependency manifests);
3. environment settings;
4. compiled defaults.

`--no-save` prevents both manifest and lockfile writes. `--force` intentionally
bypasses the normal lockfile/cache fast paths and resolves again. These options
are not equivalent: forcing a refresh does not imply that state must be saved.

## Install and resolution commands

| Command | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `pantry install [packages...]` | Resolve and install manifest dependencies or explicit package specs. Alias: `pantry i`. |
| `pantry ci` | Perform a strict install with frozen-lockfile behavior; missing or divergent lock state is an error. |
| `pantry add <packages...>` | Add constraints to the selected dependency section, install them, and update lock state unless saving is disabled. |
| `pantry remove <packages...>` | Remove dependency declarations and corresponding project content. Supports preview and global selection. |
| `pantry uninstall <packages...>` | Remove installed package content from Pantry-managed locations. |
| `pantry update [packages...]` | Re-resolve selected or all dependencies subject to constraints; `--latest` may ignore the current constraint. |
| `pantry outdated [patterns...]` | Compare installed/declared versions with the appropriate Pantry or npm registry source. |
| `pantry list` / `pantry ls` | List installed packages with table, simple, or JSON output where registered. |
| `pantry why <package>` | Explain the dependency path that caused a package to be installed. |
| `pantry tree` | Display the dependency graph with depth, production, peer, and version controls. |
| `pantry dedupe` | Reduce duplicate compatible resolutions while preserving dependency constraints. |
| `pantry link` / `pantry unlink` | Register or consume a local package without publishing it. |
| `pantry search <query>` | Search the generated Pantry catalog, then supplement it from the live Pantry registry. |
| `pantry info <package>` | Show catalog metadata, or query the live Pantry registry for a user-published package. |
| `pantry audit` | Query vulnerability data for JavaScript dependencies with severity, production, and ignore controls. |

### Install option semantics

| Option | Effect and failure behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--global` | Install into the system/global prefix rather than a project environment. |
| `--user` | Install globally for the current user under Pantry's user data directory. |
| `--force` | Fetch current metadata and reinstall; ignore the normal cache and lockfile preference. |
| `--production` | Install production dependencies and omit development dependencies. |
| `--dev` | Install only development dependencies. |
| `--peer` | Include peer dependencies when they are not enabled by project configuration. |
| `--ignore-scripts` | Do not execute package lifecycle scripts. This reduces behavior, not integrity verification. |
| `--offline` | Make no registry request; a missing resolution or tarball in local state is an error. |
| `--filter <pattern>` | Restrict a workspace operation to matching packages. |
| `--frozen-lockfile` | Reject a missing lockfile or any install result that would change it. |
| `--no-cache` | Ignore the manifest cache; this is distinct from `--force` and deleting the content cache. |
| `--dry-run` | Compute and report the plan without installing or persisting it. |
| `--no-save` | Do not change the dependency manifest or `pantry.lock`. |
| `--quiet` | Suppress progress output, but never suppress the reason for a failed install. |
| `--verbose` | Emit resolution, cache, download, environment, and install diagnostics. |

## Resolution and install pipeline

The normal project operation follows this order:

1. Discover the effective project/workspace root and dependency manifest.
2. Read `pantry.lock` and determine whether recorded constraints still match.
3. Use the lockfile fast path when every package is resolvable and destination
   content exists; otherwise resolve missing or changed packages.
4. Classify each spec as a Pantry system package, npm package, workspace package,
   local link, Git source, or another supported source.
5. Resolve exact versions and tarball URLs, retaining integrity metadata when the
   upstream registry supplies it.
6. Download in parallel unless offline or satisfied by cache.
7. Verify any supplied integrity claim before extraction.
8. Extract into managed content, create executable shims/links, and run permitted
   lifecycle hooks.
9. Update the lockfile only after successful results and only when writes are
   allowed.

Partial failures return a non-zero command result. Quiet mode may remove progress
noise but cannot convert a failure into success or hide its final reason.

## Lockfile contract

`pantry.lock` is the reproducibility boundary. It records exact package versions,
resolved locations, integrity when available, dependency relationships, and
workspace constraint state. It supports lockfile-first restore, which avoids
redundant registry resolution, and frozen validation, which compares the computed
result to committed state and rejects a missing or changed lockfile.

The lockfile does not create integrity evidence when an upstream package supplies
none. Such an entry is reproducible by version and URL but has weaker content
authentication and must not be described as cryptographically verified.

## Integrity, cache, and extraction

For npm-style tarballs, Pantry verifies a supplied raw SHA-256 digest or SRI
`sha256`, `sha512`, or legacy `sha1` value. A mismatch, malformed base64 value,
missing algorithm separator, or unsupported algorithm fails closed. When no
integrity claim exists, the installer can still validate archive structure and
uses the content cache's SHA-256 bookkeeping, but that is not equivalent to an
upstream-authenticated digest.

Downloaded content is cached by package, version, source, and checksum. A
poisoned cache entry that fails verification or extraction is evicted and may be
fetched again when networking is allowed. `--offline` never silently crosses the
network; if verified content is unavailable locally, the install fails.

Native archives are validated for expected archive structure. When a valid
sidecar checksum is available, it is checked before extraction. Absence of a
sidecar is explicitly weaker than a verified sidecar and is not a signature.

## Lifecycle scripts and trust

Lifecycle scripts execute dependency code and are therefore a separate trust
decision from checksum validation. Pantry supports `pantry trust`,
`pantry untrusted`, and `pantry default-trusted` for managing that decision.
`--ignore-scripts` is the deterministic opt-out for CI or security-sensitive
installs. An integrity match proves bytes match the declared digest; it does not
prove that running those bytes is safe.

## Workspaces and local development

Workspace installs use the workspace root for `pantry.lock`, resolve `workspace:`
ranges before publication, deduplicate shared external packages where compatible,
and retain per-workspace declared constraints. `--filter` limits the selected
workspace set. Local links are recorded in Pantry's link registry and avoid a
publish round trip; they are mutable development inputs and do not carry normal
immutable-registry guarantees.

## Publication channels

| Command | Destination and contract |
| --- | --- |
| `pantry publish` | Publish archives to the Pantry registry. The default is `https://registry.pantry.dev`; a bearer token is required. |
| `pantry npm:publish` | Publish npm-compatible packages to npm or an explicitly selected compatible registry, with token or OIDC authentication. |
| `pantry publish:check` | Validate names and registry collisions without publishing; offline mode performs syntactic checks only. |
| `pantry publish:commit` | Publish temporary, commit-addressed monorepo packages and return installable URLs. Existing names can be skipped unless forced. |
| `pantry publish:binary` | Publish a platform-specific native binary and metadata to Pantry object storage. |
| `pantry publisher:add`, `publisher:list`, `publisher:remove` | Manage npm-style trusted publisher configuration for OIDC flows. |
| `pantry sign` / `pantry verify` | Create or verify package signatures with configured Ed25519 key material. |

Pantry-registry publication and npm publication are intentionally different
surfaces. The command and selected registry determine the protocol; Pantry does
not transparently republish every npm dependency.

## Environment and installation locations

Project installs live in Pantry-managed project environments. Global installs
select the system prefix when writable, while `--user` selects the user-owned
global data directory. Custom paths are explicit and should be treated as an
operator choice because ownership, PATH behavior, and cleanup boundaries change.

Shell integration performs environment lookup on directory changes. The
environment identity incorporates project location and dependency state so two
projects, or two dependency revisions of one project, do not accidentally share
an incompatible active toolchain. Leaving the project restores the previous
environment instead of copying packages into the global shell.

## Failure modes operators should preserve

- Unknown package, impossible version, invalid manifest, or malformed lockfile:
  fail with the package/config cause.
- Frozen lockfile missing or divergent: fail without modifying it.
- Offline cache miss: fail without a network fallback.
- Integrity mismatch or unsupported integrity algorithm: fail before extraction.
- Untrusted lifecycle script: require trust or an explicit script policy.
- Registry authentication failure: fail without uploading.
- Duplicate immutable version: registry returns conflict; do not overwrite it.
- Partial workspace failure: return non-zero and do not claim complete success.
